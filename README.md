### Hi there 👋, My name is Nhan 
#### Front-end Developer 🧑‍💻

Let me tell you a story of my-self:

I am a Junior Software Engineer who has just made the first step 🐾 into the field of Information & Technology 💻. In the first days, everything seemed so new and I found it very difficult to approach them, when learning on my own, it was even more difficult 🌪. However, with a strong belief that I can do it, I did not give up, I was determined to invest more time, pay more effort in self-study. Every day I spend 8-10 hours ⏰ learning and practicing coding, from waking up 🌄 to bedtime 🌃, besides exercising 🏋️ for good health and reading books 📖 to boost my mindset 🧠, for the sustainable long-term path in this industry. From here, I realized I am passionate about coding very strongly, I spend more time, maybe 12-14 hours ⏰ a day, I don't feel tired at all but also very enthusiastic 🔥, I code so hard with strong motivation 💯. The more I code, the more I realize who I am and what I want to achieve in this amazing field 💪💪.

I love ❤️ coding, learning cutting-edge technologies for high-performance development, prolems solving for clients and society, making life better 🌍.

From my perspective, nothing is impossible, even it is a new field, as long as I keep trying, willing to learn new things, hard-working, "learn one, practice ten". I believe I can conquer anything 🏆🏆🏆.

*" Living, Learning, and Coding."*
